# Weather Observation Station 11

## Problem
Link to HackerRank Challenge: [Weather Observation Station 11](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-11/problem)

### Problem statement reproduced from HackerRank
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

The STATION table is described as follows:

| Field | Type |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| id | int |
| city | varchar(21) |
| state | varchar(2) |
| lat_n | float |
| long_w | float |

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

### Understanding the solution

- For illustration purpose, a database named `hackerrank_db` is created.
- In this `hackerrank_db`, a table named `station` is created.
- In this `station` table, test data is inserted. Querying this table produces following output.

```sql 
select * from station
```

### Expected output
Expected output should contain:
- `city` and `state` columns only.

```sql 
select distinct city from station where city like '[^aeiou]%'
```

### Additional queries

- DDL Query to create `hackerrank_db` and `station` table: [station_DDL.sql](../weather-observation-station-1/station_DDL.sql)
- DML Query to insert data into `station` table: [station_DML.sql](../weather-observation-station-1/station_DML.sql)
