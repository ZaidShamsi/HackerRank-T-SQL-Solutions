### Problem statement reproduced from HackerRank
Query a count of the number of cities in CITY having a Population larger than 100,000.

The CITY table is described as follows:

| Field | Type |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| id | int |
| name | varchar(17) |
| countrycode | varchar(3) |
| district | varchar(20) |
| population | int |

### Understanding the solution

- For illustration purpose, a database named `hackerrank_db` is created.
- In this `hackerrank_db`, a table named `city` is created.
- In this `city` table, test data is inserted. Querying this table produces following output.

```sql 
select * from city
```

id|name|countrycode|district|population
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
1|city_1|IND|IND_district_1|100000
2|city_2|IND|IND_district_1|110000
3|city_3|IND|IND_district_2|120000
4|city_4|IND|IND_district_3|130000
5|city_5|IND|IND_district_4|140000
6|city_6|USA|USA_district_1|100000
7|city_7|USA|USA_district_1|110000
8|city_8|USA|USA_district_2|120000
9|city_9|USA|USA_district_3|130000
10|city_10|USA|USA_district_4|140000
11|city_11|JPN|JPN_district_1|100000
12|city_12|JPN|JPN_district_1|110000
13|city_13|JPN|JPN_district_2|120000
14|city_14|JPN|JPN_district_3|130000
1661|city_1661|JPN|JPN_district_4|140000

### Expected output
Expected output should contain:
- only USA data: So, query should include `where` clause on `countrycode` column to filter out other countries data
- only cities with populations larger than 100000: So, `where` clause should also be applied on `population` column. Both of these conditions can be combined using `and` operator.
- So, modified query is

```sql 
select count(name) from city where population > 100000
```
id|name|countrycode|district|population
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
7|city_7|USA|USA_district_1|110000
8|city_8|USA|USA_district_2|120000
9|city_9|USA|USA_district_3|130000
10|city_10|USA|USA_district_4|140000

### Additional queries

- DDL Query to create `hackerrank_db` and `city` table: [hackerrank_DDL.sql](hackerrank_DDL.sql)
- DML Query to insert data into `city` table: [city_DML.sql](city_DML.sql)
