# Weather Observation Station 2

## Problem
Link to HackerRank Challenge: [Weather Observation Station 2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-2/problem)

### Problem statement reproduced from HackerRank
Query the following two values from the STATION table:

The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.

The STATION table is described as follows:

| Field | Type |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| id | int |
| city | varchar(21) |
| state | varchar(2) |
| lat_n | float |
| long_w | float |

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

### Understanding the solution

- For illustration purpose, a database named `hackerrank_db` is created.
- In this `hackerrank_db`, a table named `station` is created.
- In this `station` table, test data is inserted. Querying this table produces following output.

```sql 
select * from station
```

### Expected output
Expected output should contain:
- `city` and `state` columns only.

```sql 
select 
cast(sum(lat_n) as decimal(18,2)) as sum_lat_n, 
cast(sum(long_w) as decimal(18,2)) as sum_long_w
from station
```

### Additional sql queries

- DDL Query to create `hackerrank_db` and `station` table: [station_DDL.sql](../weather-observation-station-1/station_DDL.sql)
- DML Query to insert data into `station` table: [station_DML.sql](../weather-observation-station-1/station_DML.sql)
