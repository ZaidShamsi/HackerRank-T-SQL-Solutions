# Weather Observation Station 3

## Problem
Link to HackerRank Challenge: [Weather Observation Station 3](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-3/problem)

### Problem statement reproduced from HackerRank
Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

The STATION table is described as follows:

| Field | Type |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| id | int |
| city | varchar(21) |
| state | varchar(2) |
| lat_n | float |
| long_w | float |

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

### Understanding the solution

- For illustration purpose, a database named `hackerrank_db` is created.
- In this `hackerrank_db`, a table named `station` is created.
- In this `station` table, test data is inserted. Querying this table produces following output.

```sql 
select * from station
```

### Expected output
Expected output should contain:
- `city` and `state` columns only.

```sql 
select distinct city from station where id % 2 = 0
```

### Additional sql queries

- DDL Query to create `hackerrank_db` and `station` table: [station_DDL.sql](../weather-observation-station-1/station_DDL.sql)
- DML Query to insert data into `station` table: [station_DML.sql](../weather-observation-station-1/station_DML.sql)
